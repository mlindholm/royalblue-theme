# Royalblue Theme

A light and flat theme for Sublime Text 3. Loosely based on the [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) theme. Most of the icons are drawn by me, some are from [Google Material icons](https://www.google.com/design/icons/).

## Installing

You can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your **Packages** directory by using the command below:
  
    git clone https://github.com/mlindholm/royalblue-theme.git "Royalblue"

After downloading the theme add/update your theme entry to 
    
    "theme": "Royalblue.sublime-theme"

## Styles

I've created a color scheme to go with the theme. The code font shown in the screenshots is [Meslo LG S](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font) by Andr√© Berg.

    "color_scheme": "Packages/User/Royalblue.tmTheme",
    "font_face": "Meslo LG M",
    "font_size": 12,
    "indent_guide_options":
    [
      "draw_normal",
      "draw_active"
    ]
